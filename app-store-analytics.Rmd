477–487.

The paper presents an empirical study that aims to corroborate the relationship between the fault 
and change-proneness of APIs and the degree of success of Android apps measured by their user 
ratings. For this, the authors selected a sample of 7,097 free Android apps from the Google Play 
Market and gathered information of the changes and faults that the APIs used by them presented. 
Using this data and statistical tools such as box-plots and the Mann-Whitney test, two main 
hypotheses were analyzed. The first hypothesis tested the relationship between fault-proneness 
(number of bugs fixed in the API) and the success of an app. The second tested the relationship 
between change-proneness (overall method changes, changes in method signatures and changes to the 
set of exceptions thrown by methods) and the success of an app. Finally, although no causal 
relationships between the variables can be assumed, the paper found significant differences of the 
level of success of the apps taking into consideration the change and fault-proneness of the APIs 
they use.

The paper by Bavota et al. aims to find empirical evidence supporting the success of apps and the 
relationship with change- and fault-proneness of the underlying APIs, where the success of the app 
is measured by its user rating. They performed two case studies to find quantitative evidence using
5848 free Android apps as well as an explanation for these results doing a survey with 45 
professional Android developers. The quantitative case study was done by comparing the user ratings 
to the number of bug fixes and changes in the API that an app uses. They found that apps with a high
user rating are significantly less change- and fault-prone than APIs used by apps with a low user 
rating. In the second case study the paper found that most of the 45 developers observed a direct 
relationship between the user ratings of apps and the APIs those apps use.

## How can i improve my app? Classifying user reviews for software maintenance and evolution

The most popular apps in the app stores (such as Google Play or App Store) receive thousands of 
user reviews per day and therefore it would be very time demanding to go through the reviews 
manually to obtain relevant information for the future development of the apps. This paper uses a 
combination of Natural Language Processing Sentiment Analysis and Text Analysis to extract 
relevant sentences from the reviews and to classify them into the following categories: 
Information Seeking, Information Giving, Feature Request, Problem Discovery, and Others. The 
results show 75% precision and 74% recall when classifier (J48 using data from NLP+SA+TA) is 
trained on 20% of the data (1421 manually labeled sentences from reviews of seven different apps) 
and the rest is used for testing. The paper also states that the results do not differ in a 
statistically significant manner when a different classifier is used and shows that precision 
and recall can be further improved by increasing the size of the data set.
