# App Store Analytics

## Motivation
In the year 2008, the first app stores became available. These stores have grown rapidly in size 
since then, with over 3 million apps in the Google Play store alone at the time of writing 
[REFERENCE]. These app stores together with the large user bases associated with them provide 
software developers and researchers with valuable data. The process of exploiting this data from 
app stores to gain valuable insights is what we would call “App Store Analytics”. Because apps 
have not been around for a long time the research field of App Store Analytics is still very 
young. However, because apps are used so much nowadays it plays an important role in the field of 
Software Engineering. Therefore, to get an overview of the current state of this young research 
field this chapter(?) is devoted as a survey on the field of App Store Analytics. We present 
three research questions to structure this survey:

* **RQ1** Current state of the art in software analytics for App Store Analytics:
    - Topics that are being explored.
    - Research methods, tools, and datasets being used.
    - Main research findings, aggregated.

* **RQ2** Current state of practice in software analytics for App Store Analytics:
    - Tools and companies creating/employing them.
    - Case studies and their findings.

* **RQ3** Open challenges and future research required.


## Research protocol
TODO: here are just ideas of what I'm doing but they should be properly written 

The research protocol is divided into two important parts: the articles search process and the 
article selection process. In the following paragraphs, both processes will be explained. [Refer 
to Kitchenham?]

### Search queries (Article search process)
Our initial seed of the papers came from the survey of the field of App Store Analytics by Martin 
et al. [TODO: REFER to survey] and after that we used the keywords **apps**, **app store**, **app 
store analytics** and **app store mining** to search for other relevant papers on Google Scholar, 
ACM, IEEE Xplore and pages of individual journals (CSUR, TSE, EMSE, JSS, TOSEM, IST) and 
conferences (ICSE, FSE, ASE, MSR, OSDI). From the results only articles with relevant titles were 
selected and added to the list for consideration.

TODO: Include a table with journals/conferences including their full names


### Article selection
In order to retain only the most relevant papers to answer the research questions, we devised a 
composed metric that takes into account the number of citations and the year the paper was 
published. Taking these elements the scoring scheme is the following: 
Citations (C):
Year of publication (Y):
The metric is computed as follows:
Inclusion_metric = C (0.5) * Y (0.5)

For each paper the previously mentioned metric was calculated and the top 30 were selected, 
discarding the rest. 

#### Inclusion criteria
 - The paper was published in well established journal or conference.
 - Title or abstract of the paper mentions app stores, mining from app stores or app store analytics.
 - Tha paper was published in 2010 or later.

#### Exclution criteria
 - The paper has at least 10 citations on Google Scholar.
 - The paper focuses on mobile app development or is an analysis of arbitrary selection of apps
  and does not extend to the app stores as a whole.

### Fact extraction

Taking into consideration the example presented by Kitchenham et al in [reference], the following
 data were extracted from each of the papers:
- Source (journal or conference)
- Complete reference
- Main topic area
- Authors information (full names, institution, and country)
- Summary (research questions and answers)
- Research question / issue
- MORE?

Each one of the team members was in charge of reviewing and extracting the data of a set of papers
. Then, the extracted data was checked by another member. The allocation of team members to the papers was random, equally splitting the workloads.

## Answers 

* **RQ1** Current state of the art in software analytics for App Store Analytics

* **RQ2** Current state of practice in software analytics for App Store Analytics

* **RQ3** Open challenges and future research required

### API change and fault proneness: A threat to the success of Android apps

**Source:** Conference ESEC/FSE'17 Joint Meeting of the European Software Engineering Conference 
and the ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering

**Main topic area:** using user feedback/reviews, API changes

- Massimiliano Di Penta - University of Sannio, Italy
- Rocco Oliveto - University of Molise, Italy
- Denys Poshyvanyk - College of William and Mary, USA

The paper presents an empirical study that aims to corroborate the relationship between the fault 
and change-proneness of APIs and the degree of success of Android apps measured by their user 
ratings. For this, the authors selected a sample of 7,097 free Android apps from the Google Play 
Market and gathered information of the changes and faults that the APIs used by them presented. 
Using this data and statistical tools such as box-plots and the Mann-Whitney test, two main 
hypotheses were analyzed. The first hypothesis tested the relationship between fault-proneness 
(number of bugs fixed in the API) and the success of an app. The second tested the relationship 
between change-proneness (overall method changes, changes in method signatures and changes to the 
set of exceptions thrown by methods) and the success of an app. Finally, although no causal 
relationships between the variables can be assumed, the paper found significant differences of the 
level of success of the apps taking into consideration the change and fault-proneness of the APIs 
they use. 


**Research question/issue:** relationship between fault- and change-proneness of APIs and the 
degree of success in Android apps.

### What would users change in my app? summarizing app reviews for recommending software changes

**Summary (research questions and answers):** The paper proposes a new approach for analyzing App 
Store user reviews, deriving insights from them. The presented solution has two components. 
First, the User Reviews Model (URM) that enable the classification of users intentions (e.g., UI 
improvements, bug fixes, etc.). Second, the Summarizer of User Review Feedback (SURF). A tool 
that, by leveraging the URM, is capable of generating summaries of users feedback. After 
evaluating the proposed approach, TODO

**Research question/issue:** there is no approach that is able to do, at the same time, the 
following: (i) determine for a large number of reviews the speciﬁc topic discussed in the 
review (e.g., UI improvements, security/licensing issues, etc.), (ii) identify the maintenance 
task to perform for addressing the request stated in the review (e.g., bug ﬁxing, feature 
enhancement, etc.), and (iii) present such information in the form of a condensed, interactive and
 structured agenda of recommended software changes, which is actionable for developers. [Reference paper]

**Summary (research questions and answers):**
Multi-homing is not used by many developers, where multi-homing is the strategy of releasing your 
application to multiple platforms. An analysis of Google Play, App Store and Windows Phone Store 
shows that not many developers use this strategy. Next to this, the paper found that the type and 
popularity of apps does not differ from those that use a single-homing strategy.
 
**Research question/issue:** Analysis of multi-homing in different app stores. How much is it used 
by developers and is there a difference in popularity?

### The Impact of API Change and Fault-Proneness on the User Ratings of Android Apps

TODO: template

The paper by Bavota et al. aims to find empirical evidence supporting the success of apps and the 
relationship with change- and fault-proneness of the underlying APIs, where the success of the app 
is measured by its user rating. They performed two case studies to find quantitative evidence using
5848 free Android apps as well as an explanation for these results doing a survey with 45 
professional Android developers. The quantitative case study was done by comparing the user ratings 
to the number of bug fixes and changes in the API that an app uses. They found that apps with a high
user rating are significantly less change- and fault-prone than APIs used by apps with a low user 
rating. In the second case study the paper found that most of the 45 developers observed a direct 
relationship between the user ratings of apps and the APIs those apps use.

### How can i improve my app? Classifying user reviews for software maintenance and evolution

TODO: template

The most popular apps in the app stores (such as Google Play or App Store) receive thousands of 
user reviews per day and therefore it would be very time demanding to go through the reviews 
manually to obtain relevant information for the future development of the apps. This paper uses a 
combination of Natural Language Processing Sentiment Analysis and Text Analysis to extract 
relevant sentences from the reviews and to classify them into the following categories: 
Information Seeking, Information Giving, Feature Request, Problem Discovery, and Others. The 
results show 75% precision and 74% recall when classifier (J48 using data from NLP+SA+TA) is 
trained on 20% of the data (1421 manually labeled sentences from reviews of seven different apps) 
and the rest is used for testing. The paper also states that the results do not differ in a 
statistically significant manner when a different classifier is used and shows that precision 
and recall can be further improved by increasing the size of the data set.
