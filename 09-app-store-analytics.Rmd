# App Store Analytics

## Motivation 

In the year 2008, the first app stores became available [@appStoreLaunch][@androidMarketLaunch].
These marketplaces have grown rapidly in size since then with over 3.8 million apps in the Google
Play store alone as of first quarter of 2018 [@appNumber]. These app stores, together with the large
amount of user-generated data associated with them present an unprecedented source of information
about the app ecosystem. Software developers and researchers use this valuable data to gain new
insights about how users use their app, what they like and the difficulties they encounter. The
same data can also be used by the store operators to detect malicious or misbehaving apps whose
behavior does not match the description. Because these app stores are relatively new, the
research field of App Store Analytics is still not mature. However, because apps are used so much
nowadays, it plays a vital role in the field of Software Engineering.
 
In 2015, Martin, William, et al., published "A survey of app store analysis for software
engineering" [@martin2015survey]. The paper divides the field of App Store Analytics into seven
categories: API Analysis, Review Analytics, Security, Store Ecosystem, Size and Effort
Prediction, Release Engineering, and Feature Analysis. Given that relevant literature on the field
of App Store Analytics has been already gathered and analyzed, it makes sense to use this chapter
to go a step further. We delve deeper into the subfield of Review Analysis.
We started with the literature proposed by @martin2015survey and extended it with the relevant
articles that were published after 2015.  We then used the data to answer the following research
questions:

* **RQ1** What is the state of the art in Review Analysis? Specifically:
    - Which topics that are being explored?
    - Which research methods, tools, and datasets being used?
    - Which are the main research findings (aggregated)?

* **RQ2** What is the state of practice in Review Analysis? Specifically:
    - Which are the tools and the companies that create/employ them?
    - Case studies and their findings.

* **RQ3** Which are the challenges and future research that the field is facing or will face?

## Research Protocol

In this section, we explain the process that we followed to systematically extract the facts from
the articles for the literature survey. The search strategy section includes the queries that were
used, as well as the initial criteria that ware taken into account for the initial filtering of the
articles. Article selection explains how the relevance of the papers was assessed, and how the
final filtering was done. The last section describes the data extracted from each article.

### Search Strategy

As stated in the motivation, the survey by Martin et al. gave us a starting point.
Instead of gathering everything related to App Store Analytics we decided to focus on extending the
work done by the authors and answering the research questions specifically for the
subcategory of Review Analytics. All the papers that @martin2015survey
found related with Review Analytics were retrieved and inspected to get a sense of their specific
keywords and content. 

After doing this, the following search queries were generated:
```
“app store analytics” 
“app store analytics” AND “mining” 
“app store analytics” AND “user reviews” 
“app store analytics” AND “reviews”, “app reviews”
```

Google Scholar[^9], ACM Digital Library[^10], and IEEE Xplore[^11] were used for the searching
process with the queries mentioned above. In order to build a database using only the relevant
articles, the following inclusion criteria were applied to the found articles. In addition to the
results obtained by searching with the specific query, the first page of the “related articles”
link for the top cited articles was also inspected. 

| Criteria | Value        | 
|----------------|-------------|
| time frame    | 2015-present |
| journals and conferences | TSE, EMSE, JSS, IST, ICSE, FSE, MSR, OSDI, MobileSoft |
| keywords in title | user reviews OR app store reviews |
| keywords in abstract | user reviews OR app store reviews |

After the relevant articles were selected, their metadata was gathered, and they were entered into
a database. That was the input for the next step of the survey, article selection.

### Article selection
Taking into account that the papers considered in this survey were published from 2015, it is no
surprise that most of them are not highly cited. As a consequence, the selection of the filtered
articles does not take this into consideration. In contrast, each member of the group was in charge
of delving into a third of the database and finding, for each study, the *relevance* with respect
to Review Analytics and the proposed research questions. Then, this score was peer-reviewed by the
other two team members to achieve a consensus. 

For the *relevance* score, we considered how much the paper used the analysis of user reviews.
Next, we present three examples: 1) a highly relevant paper  score=10), 2) a somewhat relevant
paper (score=5) and 3) a non-relevant paper (score=0). 


**What would users change in my app? summarizing app reviews for recommending software changes
[@di2016would]** 

 - Relevance score: 10
 - Remarks: the authors applied classification and summarization techniques on app reviews to
   reduce the effort required to analyze feedback from users. As can be seen, the paper was focused
   on using the reviews to improve the development process.

**Fault in your stars: an analysis of Android app reviews [@aralikatte2018fault]** 

- Relevance score: 5
- Remarks: the authors analyzed the problem of the potential mismatch between the app reviews and
  the star ratings that the app receives. Although it is related to reviews, it is not its primary
  focus. It also does not push the state of the art regarding the datasets that they used. 

**Why are Android apps removed from Google Play? A large-scale empirical study
[@wang2018android]** 

- Relevance score: 0
- Remarks: in this case, the paper did not have to do with app reviews even though the title
  suggested otherwise.

In the end, only the articles that had a score of 5 or more were used for the fact extraction and
the subsequent answering of the research questions.

### Fact extraction

As was mentioned before, the articles were listed in a database in a structured fashion. The data
that was extracted has the following fields:

```
id for indexing
title
year 
relevance score 
relevance description 
source 
category
authors Information
source (journal or conference)
complete reference
```
Additionally, for each one of the articles, a systematic reading was carried in which bullet points
that answered the following questions were generated:

```
Paper type
Research questions of the paper
Contributions
Datasets: size and sampling methodologies
Techniques used for doing the analysis 
```

The bullet points can be found in the appendix of this chapter.

## Answers 

### **RQ1** What is the state of the art in Review Analysis? Specifically:
  - Which topics that are being explored?
  - Which research methods, tools, and datasets being used?
  - Which are the main research findings (aggregated)?

To answer the question at hand we looked at the novel ideas and the research that has been done in
this field since that time. In their survey, @martin2015survey proposed “Classification”,
“Content”, “Requirements Engineering”, “Sentiment”, “Summarization” and “Surveys and Methodological
Aspects of App Store Analysis” to categorize the existing literature. After analyzing posterior
work, we propose new categories that reflect better the state of the art in this field. These are:
“Review Manipulation”, “Mapping user reviews to the source code”, “Privacy / App Permissions”,
“Responding to reviews”, “Comparing Apps and App stores and Wearables”. In the following sections,
we expand on each one of these with the revised literature.

**Review Manipulation**

Recently, significant attention has been paid to how the reviews and ratings can be used to
influence the number of downloads of a particular app in the App Store. In their paper,
@i2017crowdsourced analyzed the use of crowdsourcing platforms such as Microworkers[^8] to
manipulate the ratings. The authors merged data from two different sources, App Store and
crowdsourcing site, to identify manipulated reviews.

In @chen2017toward the authors propose an approach to identify attackers of collusive promotion
groups in the app store. They use ranking changes and measurements of pairwise similarity to form
targeted app clusters (TAC) that they later use to pinpoint attackers. A different approach to the
same problem was proposed by @xie2016you. In the paper, the authors identify manipulated app
ratings based on the so-called attack signatures. They present a graph-based algorithm for
achieving this purpose in linear time. 

These papers also show that the percentage of manipulated apps in the app stores is not the
majority of the used samples (@xie2016you found that less than 1% of the apps were suspicious).
Regarding the datasets, the work by @i2017crowdsourced used the smaller amount of app store data.
Considering that they manage to merge it from data from an external crowdsourcing site. In the case
of the other two papers, they can be characterized by the small number of considered apps (compared
to the total number of apps in the main marketplaces), but the significant number of reviews that
were analyzed. This makes sense, considering that the main purpose is to investigate the later. 


**Requirements Engineering**
Users use reviews as a way to express their attitude (positive and negative) towards an app. Most
of the time, these reviews do not have enough information as are mostly composed of a small number
of uninformative words. Another important portion of reviews contains information that can be used
in the improvement and evolution of the apps. In the survey [@martin2015survey], Martin et al.
described summarization, classification, and requirements engineering as categories of the subfield
of Review Analytics. These areas are converging and in recent work (after 2015) it can be observed
how summarization and classification, among other techniques, are being used to complement
development, maintenance and evolution tasks. In 2016, Di Sorbo et al. introduced SURF
@di2016would, an approach to condense a large number of reviews, extracting useful information from
them. In a subsequent paper (@panichella2016ardoc), Panichella et al presented techniques for
classifying useful feedback in the context of maintenance and evolution of the apps. In their work,
the authors make use of machine learning supervised methods in conjunction with natural language
processing (NLP), sentiment analysis (SA), and text analysis (TA) techniques. Unsupervised methods
for review clustering were explored in @anchieta2017 by Anchiêta et al. In the article, the authors
introduced a technique to categorize reviews in order to generate a summary of the main bugs and
features. Taking into account the high dimensionality of the datasets that are used for review
mining, in @jha2017mining, Jha et al. proposed a semantic approach for app review classification.
By using semantic role labeling, the authors could make the classification process more efficient.
In @gao2018online, Gao et al. presented IDEA. A framework for identifying emerging app issues
effectively based on an online review analysis. To achieve this, the paper uses information from
different time slices (versions). And use the changelogs of the studied apps as the ground truth
for the validation of their approach. This is one of the only studies in the reviewed literature
that presents a case study (Tencent) as an example to the viability of IDEA. Most of the datasets
used in the papers analyzed in this section can be characterized by a small number of apps and a
considerable amount of reviews. Di Sorbo et al. @di2016would used 17 apps and 3439 reviews.
Anchiêta et al. @anchieta2017 gathered more than 50000 reviews from 3 apps, but after the
preprocessing step the dataset was reduced to 924 records. Jha et al. @jha2017mining used a
structured sampling procedure to mix reviews from different datasets. Its final size was 2917
reviews. Finally, Gao et al. @gao2018online used reviews from 6 apps (2 from the App Store and 4
from Google Play) and the final dataset contained 164,026 reviews, one of the largest that has been
used.

**Mapping user reviews to source code** Another research direction that has become active in the
past years is combining the results of mining  the app reviews with the source code to directly
provide developers with valuable and actionable information to improve their products. In
@palomba2017recommending, Palomba et al. presented a new approach called ChangeAdvisor. It extracts
useful feedback from reviews and recommends developers changes to specific software artifacts. In
the paper, metric distances such as the Dice coefficient are used in order to map a specific subset
of reviews to a section of the source code. A complementary work was presented in
@palomba2018crowdsourcing. In this study, Palomba et al. investigated the extent to which app
developers take app reviews into account. To achieve this, they introduced CRISTAL. An approach for
tracing informative crowd reviews onto source code changes, and for monitoring the extent to which
developers accommodate crowd requests and follow-up user reactions as reflected in their ratings.
Linting mechanisms and their effectivity have also been studied. In @wei2017oasis, Wei et al.
proposed  an approach, OASIS, for prioritizing the Android Lint warnings. It uses NLP techniques
(tokenization, word removing, word stemming, and TF-IDF distance) to find the links between the
user reviews and the Lint warnings. According to the paper, this is relevant given that one of the
problems of linters is the number of false alarms they provide. Regarding the datasets that were
used for validation even though the analyzed papers use a reduced amount of apps (except
@palomba2018crowdsourcing that used 100), as in the previous section, they use more reviews (more
than 20,000). Additionally, as the aim of the works in this section directly involve the
developers, they complement the quantitatively apps-reviews-based experiments with qualitative
ones. 

**Privacy / app permissions**
Since Android Marshmallow the Android operating system uses a run-time permission-based security
system. Apple's iOS also uses run-time permissions on top of a set of permissions enabled by
default. Scoccia et al. did a large-scale empirical study on this new system by inspecting 4.3
million user reviews from 5572 Google Play store apps [@scoccia2018investigation]. Using different
techniques they extracted 3574 user reviews that relate to permissions. They found that users like
the minimal permissions as most apps only ask for permissions they strictly need. Some of the
negative user concerns were apps asking for too many permissions or a bad timing asking for
permissions.


**Responding to reviews**

Since 2013 developers can respond to reviews in the Google Play store and Apple introduced the same
feature in 2017. In previous work, McIlroy [@mcilroy2014empirical] studied whether responding to
user reviews has a positive effect on the rating users give. Building on previous work McIlroy et
al. studied how likely it is for users to change their rating for an app when a developer responds
to their review [@mcilroy2017worth]. They found that users change
their rating 38.7 percent of the time when a developer responds to their review, with a median
increase of 20 percent in rating for the app.

Hassan et al. [@hassan2018studying] used 2328 top free apps from the Google Play store to study
whether users are more likely to update their review if a developer responds to their review. They
extracted 126686 dialogues between developers and users and concluded that responding to a review
increases the chances of users updating their given rating for an app can increase by up to six
times when compared to not responding. Next, to this they also studied the characteristics,
likelihood, and the incentives of user-developer dialogues in app stores.


**Comparing Apps and App stores**

Papers that compare apps or app stores are discussed in this section.  Li et  al. mined user
reviews from Google Play to find comparisons between apps [@li2017mining]. They set out to identify
comparative reviews to extract differences between apps on different topics. For example, a user
says in a review that this app is not as good regarding power consumption than another app. Li et
al. created a method that with sufficient accuracy extracts these opinions and provides comparisons
between apps. 

Ali et al. did a comparative study on cross-platform apps. They took a sample of 80.000 app-pairs
to quantitatively compare the same apps across different platforms and identify the differences
between the platforms [@ali2017same].  
In a related study Hu et al. compared app-pairs that are created using hybrid development tools
such as PhoneGap [@hu2018studying]. With this approach they found that in 33 of the 68 app-pairs
the star rating was not consistent across platforms. 


**Wearables**
User reviews can also be mined to understand user complaints, Mujahid et al. did this in a case
study on Android Wear [@mujahid2017examining]. More specifically, they sampled 589 reviews from 6
Android wearable apps and found that there were 15 unique complaint types that could be extracted
from the sample. The sample was created from mining the reviews of 4722 wearable apps and selecting
the apps that have more than 100 reviews with a rating of one or two stars. After manually
assigning categories to the reviews in the sample they concluded that the most frequent complaints
in this relatively small sample were complaints related to cost, functional errors and a lack of
functionality.

### **RQ2** What is the state of practice in Review Analysis? Specifically:

  - Which are the tools and the companies that create/employ them?
  - Case studies and their findings.

A Large amount of work has been published in the field of app store analytics (The Survey by Martin
et al. was done on over 250 papers, and our study analyzed additional 80 papers), only a tiny
amount of them were case studies. After applying the article selection criteria, we were left with
30 papers from which only two conducted a case study. First case study, done by Mujahid et al.
[@mujahid2017examining] examines issues that bother the users of Android Wear, and the second one
done by Gao et al. [@gao2018online] reports on the performance of their review analytics tool which
was deployed at Tencent. This creates a large gap between the number of proposed solutions by the
researchers and the number of studies done on the solutions that had been deployed in practice.

#### State of the app stores

We were not able to find any academic publication on the solutions used by the actual app stores
(Google Play and App Store), but we have found that both app stores automatically detect fake
reviews [^1],[^2]. In 2016 Google deployed their review analytics solution, called Review
Highlights[^3], into production for both developers and customers, but at the time of writing this
survey (October 2018), the Review Highlights no longer show up in the public facing part of Google
Play Store and are only accessible in the developer console[^4].


#### State of the third-party tools
Many third-party services focus on app store analysis. They usually focus on showing aggregated
statistics from the app stores and some of them also analyze the user review. Tools such as
AppBot[^5] or TheTool[^6] perform sentiment analysis on the reviews and show it as an additional
metric next to the star rating. AppBot also categorizes reviews based on the keywords inside them.
It may seem like a low-tech approach, but it makes it easy for the users to reason about  why a
certain review is assigned to a specific category. We were not able to find any third-party tools
that would use any of the advanced ML algorithms from the papers we analyzed. This finding combined
with Google hiding their Review Highlights may show that most of the algorithms proposed by the
researchers, do not generalize very well in the real-world application and are hard to comprehend
by regular users.

To this day there are, to the best of our knowledge, no tools that compare apps and app stores
using user reviews. Some tools analyze apps and app performance, but no tools for comparison.

### **RQ3** Which are the challenges and future research that the field is facing or will face?

In this section, we present challenges and future trends for the field of Review Analytics and the
subcategories that were identified in previous sections. 

An important component of the research process is the validation of the proposed tools and
frameworks and the assessment of how generalizable they are. For this, it is necessary to have
bigger dataset of reviews and more representative and robust samples. In terms of the techniques
being used, machine learning is a being trend and in the future approaches that are better tailored
to the problem at hand must be devised. Also, most of the studies rely on correlation relationships
to validate the effectiveness of their approaches. There is a need to apply causation techniques so
confounding factors can be ruled out.

Taking into account the practical aspect of review analytics, there is a difficulty to translate
the research into actual tools that are used in real settings. Of all the works that were
considered, only @gao2018online by Gao et al. presented a case study and most of the tools have
either disappeared or are inactive.

*Review Manipulation:*
It is important to combine multiple sources of data to better identify suspicious individuals.
These include not only app stores, but also crowdsourcing sites and even social networks. Also, the
sample should be carefully selected, given that the number of suspicious apps is not large (around
1% of all apps), taking into account the size of the app stores.

*Requirements Engineering:* 
More case studies are needed in order to validate how useful the extracted requirements are in the
context of software development. Also, as machine learning is starting to be heavily used, models
that are tailored to the reviews data will be created. The large amounts of noise that is present
in the reviews is still a challenge that needs a careful study of the preprocessing steps that are
used while assembling the datasets.

*Mapping user reviews to source code:*
There is a need to better understand the “language of source code” as this will be important to
join the reviews and source code datasets. A likely future trend is the analysis of update-level
changes. Regarding this, there is still a need to obtain update-categorized reviews as this is
still a challenge with the current review-retrieving approaches.

*Privacy / app permissions:*
Quantifying and understanding the effects of run-time permission requests on the user experience is
still an open research area which can help increasing the quality of apps. One of the directions
for further research regarding permissions is the idea of giving permissions to individual app
functionalities instead of giving permissions to the app as a whole. This could lead to users
better understanding why an app needs a certain permission and could reduce the amount of
permissions an app needs. Another possible future direction is researching and creating tools that
help developers put permission requests in the right place to avoid bugs related to permissions and
permission requests.

*Responding to reviews:*
There is a need for an in-depth study of how developers and users are using the review mechanism
right now to find out how the mechanism can be improved. Right now developers can respond to 500
user reviews per day using the Google Play API[^7]. It could be worth investigating whether a limit
of 500 responses is sufficient to ban useless responses from the store such as thanking every user.

*Comparing Apps and App stores:*
One of the open challenges is including indirect relationships in the comparisons as only direct
relationships were used in work by Li et al. [@li2017mining]. Next to this, it has been noted that
apps that have been developed using hybrid development tools had relatively low ratings. Future
studies should be done to investigate the quality of hybrid apps and compare them with the quality
of native apps. Furthermore, to get more complete results research should focus on a market-scale
analysis using a large number of apps and reviews.

**Summary (research questions and answers):** The paper proposes a new approach to analyzing App
Store user reviews, deriving insights from them. The presented solution has two components. First,
the User Reviews Model (URM) that enable the classification of users intentions (e.g., UI
improvements, bug fixes, etc.). Second, the Summarizer of User Review Feedback (SURF). A tool that,
by leveraging the URM, is capable of generating summaries of users feedback.  After evaluating the
proposed approach, TODO

**Research question/issue:** there is no approach that is able to do, at the same time, the
following: (i) determine for a large number of reviews the specific topic discussed in the review
(e.g., UI improvements, security/licensing issues, etc.), (ii) identify the maintenance task to
perform for addressing the request stated in the review (e.g., bug fixing, feature enhancement,
etc.), and (iii) present such information in the form of a condensed, interactive and structured
agenda of recommended software changes, which is actionable for developers [@di2016would].


### API change and fault proneness: A threat to the success of Android apps

The paper presents an empirical study that aims to corroborate the relationship between the fault
and change-proneness of APIs and the degree of success of Android apps measured by their user
ratings. For this, the authors selected a sample of 7,097 free Android apps from the Google Play
Market and gathered information on the changes and faults that the APIs used by them presented.
Using this data and statistical tools such as box-plots and the Mann-Whitney test, two main
hypotheses were analyzed. The first hypothesis tested the relationship between fault-proneness
(number of bugs fixed in the API) and the success of an app. The second tested the relationship
between change-proneness (overall method changes, changes in method signatures and changes to the
set of exceptions thrown by methods) and the success of an app. Finally, although no causal
relationships between the variables can be assumed, the paper found significant differences in the
level of success of the apps taking into consideration the change and fault-proneness of the APIs
they use. 


**Research question/issue:** a relationship between fault- and change-proneness of APIs and the
degree of success in Android apps.

### App Store, Marketplace, Play! An Analysis of Multi-Homing in Mobile Software Ecosystems

**Summary (research questions and answers):** Multi-homing is not used by many developers, where
multi-homing is the strategy of releasing your application to multiple platforms. An analysis of
Google Play, App Store and Windows Phone Store shows that not many developers use this strategy.
Next to this, the paper found that the type and popularity of apps does not differ from those that
use a single-homing strategy.
 
**Research question/issue:** Analysis of multi-homing in different app stores. How much is it used
by developers and is there a difference in popularity?
