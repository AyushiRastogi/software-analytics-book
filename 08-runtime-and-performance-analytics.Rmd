# Runtime and Performance Analytics

In this chapter, we discuss the field of performance and runtime analytics. This chapter does not
cover the entire field because it is too broad. Using Kitchenham’s method
[@kitchenham2004procedures], we have narrowed down the scope of this survey.

For inspiration, we started reading five recent papers on runtime and performance analytics
published at top conferences. These five were selected because the papers handle the software side
of performance and runtime analytics which is more in line with the other chapters of this book.
However, focussing on only software, the field is still very broad. We have chosen to focus on the field of performance vs. Energy consumption. This chioce was made due to it being a very current and thriving domain within Runtime and performance analysis.

## Introduction
Energy consumption plays a big role in day-to-day usage of software. Especially in the field of software development for mobile devices, for which energy consumption results in a negative effect on the battery duration and hence limiting the usage time of the device. Although the importance of energy efficient software is clear, programmers lack the knowledge of the best practices to reduce software energy consumption, and education is not focused on this field either [ref:PHA2016]. In an analysis of questions posted on StackOverflow on the topic of energy efficiency performed by Pinto et. al. [ref:PCL2014] it was found that although programmers had questions related to energy efficiency, they rarely got the appropriate advice. 
With over 2 billion daily smartphone and tablet users worldwide [ref:NPPPZL2017] it is clear that this lack of knowledge needs to be addressed. To help the programmers close this knowledge gap, hardware-based tools have been introduced. These tools can determine the energy profile of an application with high precision, but it means the costly hardware components need to be acquired[ref:NPPPZL2017]. Software-based solutions solve the problem of requiring expensive hardware, and are easier to use, but also less precise. 

In this chapter the current state of energy efficiency in software development for mobile devices will be analysed. This research will be conducted by following three research questions:

* **RQ1:** What is the state of the art of energy efficiency in software development for mobile devices?
* **RQ2:** What is the state of practice for energy efficiency in software development for mobile devices?
* **RQ3:** What future work needs to be researched in the field of energy efficiency in software development for mobile devices?

In the following paragraph the methodology of the research will be elaborated. After that each research questions will be answered in a separate paragraph. In the last paragraph of this chapter the conclusion on energy efficiency in software development for mobile devices will be made.


##Methodology
In order to find answers to the research questions, over 30 papers in the field have been selected. These papers have been found by searching on Google Scholar with a set of filters. First off, only papers from the following journals and conference are selected:

* ACM Transactions on Software Engineering Methodology (TOSEM),
* Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE),
* IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE),
* Information and Software Technology (IST),
* Journal of Systems and Software (JSS),
* ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),
* Foundations of Software Engineering (SIGSOFT FSE),
* International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE),
* Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR)
* Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI)

The following criteria is given by the activity and relative newness of the field. The preference is given to papers which are published not too long ago, preferably after 2012. But if well cited, and with interesting findings, older papers can also be used.

Given these two criteria the following search queries have been used:

* "Android AND Energy Efficiency AND Software"
* "Energy AND Android AND Runtime AND Analysis AND performance AND Software"

From the selected papers some backward and forward references have also been selected, to get a complete picture. All papers are also checked for relevance to the topic.

To answer **RQ1** a more in-depth look at available tools for the energy efficiency is performed. The focus for **RQ2** is on what is currently used in Android application that are actively used. **RQ3** is answered by the finding of the papers used for both RQ1 and RQ2.

##State of the Art

Many researchers found that there is increasing demand for energy efficient software. In their research they often propose state of the art approaches to assisting developers. These approaches can be separated into two main categories: tools and guidelines. This section will contain an overview of all state of the art tools and guidelines that satisfy our search criteria [REFERENCE TO METHODOLOGY]. This overview is used to  answer RQ1.

tools

Most of the state of the art tools can be classified as performing either measurement of energy consumption or code analysis. Although plenty of such tools have been proposed, with low citation numbers, none of them seem to have had a big influence in the research area. There is, however, the possibility, with growing demand for energy efficiency, that the amount and quality of tools will increase in the near future. 

Guidelines

The guidelines presented in these papers aim to either provide general coding practices or they explain how to involve energy efficiency in a specific domain.

##State of Practice
Now that we have an overview of the state of the art regarding energy consumption on Android driven mobile devices, we investigate what the current state of practice is. In this section, we try to find an answer to RQ2 stated in the introduction by going through the papers we have retrieved using the methodology described in Section 2. First, we study how different software engineering approaches affect energy consumption and if developers have any knowledge or training regarding energy saving programming techniques. Furthermore, we try to see if there are any tools being used which help decreasing energy consumption. To make this more specific, we divide RQ2 into several sub research questions:

* **SQ1:** What are the current development approaches used in practice and how does that affect energy consumption?
* **SQ2:** What do programmers currently know and do about energy saving app development?

###Answering SQ1
Under development approaches, the language used to write the app is one of the things that is taken into consideration. There have been a number of studies into the effects of using a certain programming language in the applications. Java is still the most used language for Android applications. According to Oliveira et al. [ref:OOC2017], Java is actually not a good choice when limiting energy consumption is one of your priorities. One of the contributions of the paper is a study where hybrid implementations of applications are compared with the original, pure Java implementations in terms of energy consumption and performance. The paper suggests that hybrid implementations might be a good solution, but the problem is that the study was done on just four Android applications. The paper did use the Rosetta Code repository, but this does not represent commercial software development.

Another comparable recent research paper investigated the energy-delay product (EDP) which is defined as  “a weighted function of the energy consumption and run-time performance product” [ref:GKLS2018] :\s\s
E * T^w
where E is the total energy used to complete a task, T the time and w is a value that represents how important energy saving is with regard to time. The advantage of using this function is that performance is not neglected. The results in the paper show that the programming language should be chosen depending on the task. From these results, it is clear that Java is not performing well when comparing it to other languages as can be seen Table [ref:to table nr].  However, it should be noted that the paper does not test this on actual Android applications but rather the Rosetta Code repository.

The above two papers are examples of research that suggest that the current state of practice, developing applications in Java only, is not in line with the current state of the art on energy efficiency. In spite of these research papers, developers are still working mostly with Java. One possible explanation is that Java is simply compatible with almost every system due to the JVM. We suggest that further research should investigate why developers are sticking to Java. For example, looking at available libraries, coding difficulty and available tools and knowledge might have a significant impact on this choice.

###Answering SQ2
In the previous sections we have seen examples of the state of the art, as well as development methods that could lead to improvements in energy consumption. However, this knowledge only holds value when the community can get developers willing to use these. There have been a number of studies that look into what is actually happening.

One example is the paper by Moura et al. [ref:MPEC2015]. In this paper a study is conducted by looking at  a large number of energy-aware commits with Github as the primary data source. This analysis has yielded a list of approaches that are being used by developers in practice. These include: frequency and voltage scaling, using power efficient libraries and more. The study notes that the vast majority of the commits focus on the lower levels of the software stack. Furthermore, only 16.2% of the commits were related to using more efficient libraries or data structures.  There are also a number of software qualities that have been shown to take precedence of the energy consumption. These include correctness, responsiveness and performance. Another point which the research addressed is whether software developers were certain of their energy saving commits. The paper suggests that there are definitely cases where developers are not certain about their energy saving change. This might be caused by the fact that there are few user friendly tools available for aiding developers in making energy-aware decisions. 

##Future research
In this section we will take a look at the suggested future research directions that have been mentioned in the papers used in this survey. We attempt to extract some general trend from the future research suggestions that are included. One of the fields of research we looked at in the previous sections was the relation between programming languages and energy consumption. Multiple papers suggest that the programming language used for implementation has an influence on the energy consumption and performance [ref:GKLS2018, OOC2017]. These papers however do not look into the influence of specific features of the programming languages on energy consumption and performance. Or rather the specific characteristics of a programming language that cause the differences, as described in the paper by Georgiou et al.

In the investigations of this report, we came across a number of tools which can be used to aid developers in their management of the energy consumption of applications. However, to our knowledge, there are no studies reporting on the actual use of such tools. For future research, we suggest investigating the amount of developers actually using such tools. Furthermore, it is important what features such tools should have for optimal use. For example, we replicated the paper that introduces jStanley, a tool which can be used for energy and performance optimization [ref:PSCS2018]. We faced the issue that this tool cannot implement the suggested improvements in an easy and efficient way. For example, we took the AssertJ open source project from GitHub and there were more than 300 energy saving suggestions. A user has to click on every suggestion to actually implement the improvement which is tedious work.
Similarly, a lot of the papers reporting on tools that could be used in practice are currently being tested with benchmarks. However, it is always the question whether these benchmarks are representative enough of the real world to hold actual merit.
