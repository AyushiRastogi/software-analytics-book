## Motivation
Imagine playing a game and out of a sudden the application is freezes. This is one of the scenarios
of a bug in a program. Such unexpected events can be frustrating and could even lead to damages.

# Research protocol
The papers used in this paper were found by using a given initial seed of papers (query defined 
below as 'Initial Paper Seed'). From this initial seed of papers we used the keywords used by those
papers to construct queries, additionally the references (‘referenced by’) and the citations
(‘cited in’) of the papers were used to find papers. The query row of the tables describing the
references as found in below indicates how a paper was found. For queries the default search sites
were Scopus, Google Scholar and Springer.

The keywords were: software, test*, analytics, test-suite, evolution, software development,
computer science, software engineering, risk-driven, survey software testing

The table below describers for each paper, which query technique was used.
