# Build analytics

## Background

When building a project from source code to executables everything should go smoothly. This is not
always the case, a build can break for several reasons. This chapter will give an overview of
research done on build scripts and continuous integration.

<!--
 - Define build
 - Define context

## Research Questions

<!-- Subject to change -->

 * What are causes of a broken build?
 * With which goals is continuous integration applied?
 * What can be used to effectively fix a broken build?

## Search Strategy

Using the initial seed consisting of @bird2017predicting, @beller2017oops, @rausch2017empirical,
@beller2017travistorrent, @pinto2018work, @zhao2017impact, @widder2018m and @hilton2016usage we
used references and similar keywords to find new papers to analyze.

## Study Selection

Through this we found the following papers

## Summary of papers

### @bird2017predicting

This is a US patent grant for a method of predicting software build errors. This patent is owned
by Microsoft. Using logistic regression a prediction can be made on the probability of a build
failing. Using this method build errors can be better anticipated, which decreases the time until
the build works again.

### @beller2017oops

This paper explores data from Travis CI^[See https://travis-ci.org] on a large scale by analyzing
2,640,825 build logs of Java and Ruby builds. It uses <span
style="font-variant:small-caps">TravisTorrent</span> as a data source. It is found that the number
one reason for failing builds it test failure. It also explores differences in testing between
Java and Ruby.

### @rausch2017empirical

A stuy on the build results of 14 open source software Java projects. It is similar to
@beller2017oops, albeit on a smaller scale. It does go more in depth on the result and changes
over time.

### @beller2017travistorrent

This paper introduces <span style="font-variant:small-caps">TravisTorrent</span>, a dataset
containing analyzed builds from more than 1,000 projects. This data is freely downloadable from
the internet. It uses <span style="font-variant:small-caps">GHTorrent</span> to link the
information from travis to commits on GitHub.

### @pinto2018work

This paper is a survey amongst Travis CI users. It found that users are not sure whether a job
failure represents a failure or not, that inadequate testing is the most common (technical) reason
for build breakage and that people feel that there is a false sense of confidence when blindly
trusing tests.

### @zhao2017impact

<!-- Note: Interesting collab between Nanjing (China), Eindhoven (Netherlands), UC Davis (USA) and Carnegie Mellon (USA). -->

This paper analyzed approximately 160,000 projects written in seven different programming
languages. It notes that adoption of CI is often part of a reorganization. It collected
information on the differences before and after adoption of CI. There is also a survey amongst
developers to learn about their experiences in adopting Travis CI.

### @widder2018m

This paper analyzes what factors have impact on abandonment of Travis. They find that increased
build complexity reduces the chance of abandonment, but larger projects abandon at a higher rate
and that a project's language has significant but varying effect. A surprising result is that
metrics of configuration attempts and knowledge dispersion in the project don't affect the rate of
abandonment.

### @hilton2016usage

This paper explores which CI system developers use, how developers use CI and why developers use
CI. For this it analyzes data from Github, Travis CI and it conducts a developer survey. It finds
that projects using CI release twice as often, accept pull requests faster and have developers who
are less worried about breaking the build.

### @vassallo2017tale

This paper discusses the difference in failures on continuous integration between open source
software (OSS) and industrial software projects. For this 349 Java OSS projects and 418 project
from ING Nederland, a financial organization.

Using cluser analysis it was observed that both kinds of projects share similar build failures,
but in other cases very different patterns emerge.

### @hassan2018hirebuild

This paper uses TravisTorrent (@beller2017travistorrent) to show that 22% of code commits include
changes in build script files to keep the build working or to fix the build.

In the paper a tool is proposed to automatically fix build failures based on previous changes.

### @vassallo2018break

This paper proposes a tool called <span style="font-variant:small-caps">BART</span> to help
developers fix build errors. This tool eliminates the need to browse error logs which can be very
long by generating a summary of the failure with useful information.

### @zampetti2017open

This paper studies the usage of static analysis tools in 20 Java open source software projects
hosted on GitHub and using Travic CI as continuous integration infrastructure. There is
investigated which tools are being used, what types of issues make the build fail or raise
warnings and how is responded to broken builds.
