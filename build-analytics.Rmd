# Build analytics

## Background

When building a project from source code to executables everything should go smoothly. This is not
always the case, a build can break for several reasons. This chapter will give an overview of
research done on build scripts and continuous integration.

<!--
 - Define build
 - Define context

## Research Questions

<!-- Subject to change -->

 * What are causes of a broken build?
 * With which goals is continuous integration applied?

## Search Strategy

Using the initial seed consisting of @bird2017predicting, @beller2017oops, @rausch2017empirical,
@beller2017travistorrent, @pinto2018work, @zhao2017impact, @widder2018m and @hilton2016usage we
used references and similar keywords to find new papers to analyze.

## Study Selection

Through this we found the following papers

### @vassallo2017tale

Discusses the difference in failures on continuous integration between open source software (OSS)
and industrial software projects. For this 349 Java OSS projects and 418 project from ING
Nederland, a financial organisation.

Using cluser analysis it was observed that both kinds of projects share similar build failures,
but in other cases very different patterns emerge.

### @hassan2018hirebuild

This paper uses TravisTorrent (@beller2017travistorrent) to show that 22% of code commits include changes in build script files to keep the build working or to fix the build.

In the paper a tool is proposed to automatically fix build failures based on previous changes.
