# Ecosystem Analytics

 Software ecosystems are a combination of systems that a community of developers uses to maintain
their software projects. By doing analysis on these systems people hope to find meaningful insights
that could lead to improvements of the software development process. For our literature review, we
started with the initial seed of papers that were assigned to us. After reviewing them we have decided
that we would not use one, and that we had 3 that were debatable. In the table below we have made
an overview of all these papers. The first column describes whether we are going to use them. A 
'+' means we will use it, a '-' means we will not, and empty means we are still unsure. The 
keywords are the actual keywords from the paper.

Next we have queried Google Scholar for relevant papers. The main queries that we have used to
search are "software ecosystems", "analysis" and "empirical". In the "Query Used" column you can 
see the query that we have inputted into the search engine. Any additional filters that were used
are in the "Filters Used" column. A summary can be found below.

Finally we have also analyzed particular relevant papers that were referenced by the papers that we have found 
before. The original paper that they were referenced in can be found in the "Referenced In" 
column.
