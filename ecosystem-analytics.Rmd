# Ecosystem Analytics

## Motivation
In the modern day and age, the majority of software products make use of external software or
libraries to use the functionality of these products, without having to develop this functionality
itself. Moreover, multiple languages, such as Python and Rust, provide package managers (pip[^1]
and Cargo[^2] respectively) which can be used to easily manage this third-party functionality, as
well as distribute it.

Together with this comes the growth in open source projects. On platforms such as GitHub[^3], it
is easy and quick to create a new software product, which can be developed, reviewed and used by
the whole community.

This in turn leads to intertwined landscapes of software products, which are deemed a
_software ecosystems_.
As stated by @Messerschmitt2003, a _software ecosystem_ is "a collection of software products that
have some given degree of symbiotic relationships." Another, similar definition is given by
@Lungu2009: "A software ecosystem is a collection of software projects which are developed and
co-evolve in the same environment." @Mens2013 extends this definition, "by explicitly considering
the communities involved (e.g. user and developer communities) as being part of the software
ecosystem."

By performing analysis on these software ecosystems, people aim to generate meaningful insights,
which can then be used to improve the efficiency and effectivity of the software development
process throughout the lifecycle of the developed software.

In order to perform a survey on the current progress in the field of software ecosystem analytics,
we have formulated three research questions:

* **RQ1**: What is the current state of the art in software analytics for ecosystem analytics?
* **RQ2**: What is the current state of practice in software analytics for ecosystem analytics?
* **RQ3**: What are the open challenges in ecosystem analytics, for which future research is
required?

Each of these research questions will be answered, using recent papers written in this field of
research.

## Research Protocol

In order to select literature to answer the research questions given in the previous section, the
survey method suggested by @Kitchenham2004 is used. This method creates a systematic way to select
a set of papers, which is relevant to the research question(s).

The search strategy, as described by @Kitchenham2004, are usually iterative and benefit from
consultations with experts in the field, amongst other things. Our search strategy can be split in
three different types:

* the initial seed, given by an expert in the field, MSc. Joseph Hejderup
* a search using a digital search engine, namely Google Scholar[^3]
* a selection of referenced papers within papers selected before in the above two searches

### Initial seed
The first type is quite straightforward. To give this survey a head start, MSc. Joseph Hejderup
has provided us with a total of thirteen papers, as shown in Table 1.

As each of these papers come from an expert in the field, each paper is assumed to be relevant to
atleast the field of software ecosystems. Because of this, each of these papers were judged on
their relevance to either of the research questions. In Table 1, this relevance judgment is shown
in the left column, since a paper is only selected, if the paper is indeed relevant. Table 2
describes the reason for which each particular paper is not selected for the literature survey.

### Digital Search Engine
The second strategy type which is used to select relevant papers for this literature study, is by
a digital search engine. In this literature survey, Google Scholar[^3] is used. The following
queries have been used to search for relevant papers:

* "software ecosystems" AND "empirical analysis" _(2018)_
* "engineering software ecosystems" _(2014)_
* "software ecosystem" AND "empirical" _(2014)_
* "software ecosystem analytics" _(2014)_
* "software ecosystem" AND "analysis" _(2017)_
* "software ecosystem" AND "empirical" _(2018)_

For each of these queries, the results were first filtered by the publish year. These are
described by the italic year after each query above. The papers that are filtered are published
earlier than the set publish year.

After this filtering, we first determined whether a paper was relevant to the literature survey by
examining the title. If it was unclear whether the paper was indeed relevant by only looking at
the title, the abstract of the paper was examined closely. On these two criteria, each of the
selected papers were judged and ultimately selected. The selected paper using these method can be
found in Table 3.

### Referenced papers
Finally, a selection of papers has been made by looking at the references found in papers
selected using the two methods above. For these papers, the selection process is similar to that
of the selected papers using the digital search engine; it is selected when both the title and the
abstract are deemed relevant to the research questions. This has led to the papers in Table 4.
being selected.
