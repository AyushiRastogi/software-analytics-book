# Release Engineering Analytics

## Motivation

Release engineering is a relatively new research topic,
given that modern processes for releasing software (e.g. continuous delivery)
are industry-driven.
Therefore, we took an exploratory approach in collecting any literature
revolving around the topic of release engineering from the perspective of
software analytics.
This will aid us in determining a more narrow scope for our survey,
subsequently allowing us to find additional literature fitting this scope.

### Search Strategy

At the start of this project,
five papers were given to us as a starting point for the literature survey.
These initial papers were @adams2016a, @da2016a, @d2014a, @khomh2012a, and
@khomh2015a.

We collected publications using two search engines: Scopus and Google Scholar.
These each encompass various databases such as ACM Digital Library, Springer,
IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect.
The queries we entered are summarized in Figure 1.
The publications found using this query were:

- @kaur2019a
- @kerzazi2013a
- @castelluccio2017a
- @karvonen2017a
- @claes2017a
- @fujibayashi2017a
- @souza2015a
- @laukkanen2018a

_Figure 1. Query used for retrieving release engineering publications via Scopus._

In addition to the search strategy that is based on a combination of keywords
and subject headings as described above, a review of the list of publications
that retrieved papers cite and are cited by is done.
These lists are provided by Google Scholar,
as well as the reference lists of the papers themselves.
Results of which are listed in Table 1.

### Study Selection

All papers that were found, were stored in a
custom built web-based tool for conducting literature reviews.
The source code of this tool is published in a
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/jessetilro/research).

In this tool, it is possible to label papers with tags
and leave comments and ratings.
Every paper is reviewed based on the selection criteria.
Based on this, the tool allowed to filter out all papers
that appeared not to be relevant for this literature survey.

The selection criteria are as follows:

1. The study must show (at least) one release engineering technique.
1. The study must not just show a release engineering technique,
   but analyze its performance compared to other techniques.

Based on these selection criteria,
the following papers appeared to be irrelevant for the scope of this survey:

<!-- Example. TODO: actually exclude papers -->
- [link to paper] - Excluded based on rule 2.

### Study Quality Assessment

Based on @kitchenham2004procedures, the quality of a paper will be assessed
by the evidence it provides, based on the following scale.
All levels of quality will be accepted, except for level 5 (expert opinion).

1. Evidence obtained from at least one properly-designed
   randomised controlled trial.
2. Evidence obtained from well-designed pseudo-randomised controlled trials
   (i.e. non-random allocation to treatment).
3. Comparative studies in a real-world setting:
    1. Evidence obtained from comparative studies with concurrent controls and
       allocation not randomised, cohort studies, case-control studies or
       interrupted time series with a control group.
    2. Evidence obtained from comparative studies with historical control,
       two or more single arm studies,
       or interrupted time series without a parallel control group.
4. Experiments in artificial settings:
    1. Evidence obtained from a randomised experiment performed in an
       artificial setting.
    2. Evidence obtained from case series,
       either post-test or pre-test/post-test.
    3. Evidence obtained from a quasi-random experiment performed in an
       artificial setting.
5. Evidence obtained from expert opinion based on theory or consensus.

Also, the studies will be examined to see if they contain any type of bias.
For this, the same types of biases will be used as described by @kitchenham2004procedures:

- Selection/Allocation bias: Systematic difference between comparison groups
  with respect to treatment.
- Performance bias: Systematic difference is the conduct of comparison groups
  apart from the treatment being evaluated.
- Measurement/Detection bias: Systematic difference between the groups in how
  outcomes are ascertained.
- Attrition/Exclusion bias: Systematic differences between comparison groups in
  terms of withdrawals or exclusions of participants from the study sample.

The studies will be labeled by their quality level and possible biases.
This information can be used during the Data Synthesis phase
to weigh the importance of individual studies [@kitchenham2004procedures].

### Data Extraction
To accurately capture the information contributed by each publication in our
survey, we will use a systematic approach to extracting data.
To guide this process, we will be using a data extraction form which describes
what aspects of a publication are crucial to record.
Besides general publication information (title, author etc.), the form contains
questions that are based on our defined research questions.
Furthermore, the form contains a section for quantitative research, where
aspects such as population and evaluation will be documented.
The form that is used for this is shown below:

```
General information:
	Name of person extracting data:
	Date form completed (dd/mm/yyyy):

### Data Synthesis
To summarize the contributions and limitations of each of the included
publications, we will apply a descriptive synthesis approach.
In this part of our survey, we will compare the data that was extracted of the
included publications.
Publications with similar findings will be grouped and evaluated, and
differences between groups of publications will be structured and elaborated on.
In this we will compare them using specifics such as their study types, time of
publication and study quality.

If the extracted data allows for a structured tabular visualization of
similarities and differences between publications this we serve as an additional
form of synthesis. However, this depends on the final included publications of
this survey.
