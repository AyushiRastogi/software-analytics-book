# Release Engineering Analytics

## Search Strategy
Release engineering is a relatively new research topic,
given that modern processes for releasing software (e.g. continuous delivery)
are industry-driven.
Therefore, we took an exploratory approach in collecting any literature
revolving around the topic of release engineering from the perspective of
software analytics.
This will aid us in determining a more narrow scope for our survey,
subsequently allowing us to find additional literature fitting this scope.

At the start of this project,
five papers were given to us as a starting point for the literature survey.
These initial papers were @adams2016a, @da2016a, @d2014a, @khomh2012a, and
@khomh2015a.

We collected publications using two search engines: Scopus and Google Scholar.
These each encompass various databases such as ACM Digital Library, Springer,
IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect.
The queries we entered as well as the results they yielded are summarized in
Figure 1.

_Figure 1. Query used for retrieving release engineering publications via Scopus._

In addition to the search strategy that is based on a combination of keywords
and subject headings as described above, a review of the list of publications
that retrieved papers cite and are cited by is done.
These lists are provided by Google Scholar,
as well as the reference lists of the papers themselves.
Results of which are listed in Table 1.

In order to aggregate our collective efforts, selected sources were stored in a
custom built web-based tool for conducting literature reviews.
The source code of this tool is published in a
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/jessetilro/research).
By commenting on and tagging our findings we were able to export a filtered
list of publications,
the relevance of which was agreed upon.
