# Release Engineering Analytics

## Motivation

Release engineering is a discipline involved with making software available for
end users.
Efforts spent within the development environment of a software system
should eventually be integrated and deployed such that end users may benefit
from them.
In recent years, release engineers have developed and
adopted techniques to build infrastructures and pipelines which automate the
process of releasing software to an increasingly large degree.
These modern approaches have resulted
in various practices such as releasing new versions of a software system in
significantly shorter cycles.

Due to these developments being industry-driven, release engineering forms a
largely uncharted territory for software engineering research.
It requires the attention from researchers both because these new practices
have an often unanticipated impact on software studies and because they require
empirical validation [@adams2016a].

Therefore, this systematic literature review aims to provide an overview of
the software analytics research that has been conducted so far on release
engineering. Its main purpose is to identify the apparent gap
between research and practice, in order to guide further research efforts.

### Research Questions

Contrary to what is regularly the case, with release engineering, practice
seems to be ahead of research.
Building on this idea, our questions are constructed to identify in which ways
existing modern release engineering practices should still be studied in
software analytics research.
Our review thus aims to answer the following questions.

<!-- TODO -->
- **RQ 1:** _How is modern release engineering done in practice?_<br>
  This question aims to identify the so-called "state of the practice" in
  release engineering.
  We will summarize practices that have been adopted to drive release
  engineering forward. In addition we will identify the tools utilized to bring
  this about. Case studies will also be analyzed to this end.

- **RQ 2:** _What aspects of modern release engineering have been studied
  in software analytics research so far?_<br>
  In order to answer this question we investigate the practices that previous
  empirical studies have focused on. In doing so, we identify the associated
  costs and benefits that have been found, and the analysis methods used.

- **RQ 3:** _What aspects of modern release engineering make for relevant
  study objects in future software analytics research?_<br>
  In answering this question we aim to identify the gap between practice and
  research in release engineering. This way, our intent is not only to guide
  but also to motivate future research.

### Search Strategy

Since release engineering is a relatively new research topic,
we took an exploratory approach in collecting any literature revolving around
the topic of release engineering from the perspective of software analytics.
This aided us in determining a more narrow scope for our survey,
subsequently allowing us to find additional literature fitting this scope.

At the start of this project, we were provided with an initial seed of five
papers as a starting point for our literature survey.
These initial papers were @adams2016a, @da2016a, @d2014a, @khomh2012a, and
@khomh2015a.

We collected publications using two search engines: Scopus and Google Scholar.
These each encompass various databases such as ACM Digital Library, Springer,
IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect.
The main query that we constructed is displayed in Figure 1.
The publications found using this query were:

- @kaur2019a
- @kerzazi2013a
- @castelluccio2017a
- @karvonen2017a
- @claes2017a
- @fujibayashi2017a
- @souza2015a
- @laukkanen2018a

_Figure 1. Query used for retrieving release engineering publications via Scopus._

In addition to querying search engines as described above,
references related to retrieved papers were analyzed.
For each paper, the review concerned the publications cited by the paper,
as well as those citing the paper.
These reference lists were obtained from Google Scholar and from the reference
lists in the papers themselves.
The results of the reference analysis are listed in Table 1.

_Table 1. Papers found indirectly by investigating citations of/by other papers._

In order to aggregate our collective efforts, selected sources were stored in a
custom built web-based tool for conducting literature reviews.
The source code of this tool is published in a
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/jessetilro/research).
