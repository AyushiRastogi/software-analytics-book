# Release Engineering Analytics

## Motivation

Release engineering is a relatively new research topic,
given that modern processes for releasing software (e.g. continuous delivery)
are industry-driven.
Therefore, we took an exploratory approach in collecting any literature
revolving around the topic of release engineering from the perspective of
software analytics.
This will aid us in determining a more narrow scope for our survey,
subsequently allowing us to find additional literature fitting this scope.

### Search Strategy

At the start of this project,
five papers were given to us as a starting point for the literature survey.
These initial papers were @adams2016a, @da2016a, @d2014a, @khomh2012a, and
@khomh2015a.

We collected publications using two search engines: Scopus and Google Scholar.
These each encompass various databases such as ACM Digital Library, Springer,
IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect.
The queries we entered are summarized in Figure 1.
The publications found using this query were:

- @kaur2019a
- @kerzazi2013a
- @castelluccio2017a
- @karvonen2017a
- @claes2017a
- @fujibayashi2017a
- @souza2015a
- @laukkanen2018a

_Figure 1. Query used for retrieving release engineering publications via Scopus._

In addition to the search strategy that is based on a combination of keywords
and subject headings as described above, a review of the list of publications
that retrieved papers cite and are cited by is done.
These lists are provided by Google Scholar,
as well as the reference lists of the papers themselves.
Results of which are listed in Table 1.

### Study Selection

In order to aggregate our collective efforts, selected sources were stored in a
custom built web-based tool for conducting literature reviews.
The source code of this tool is published in a
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/jessetilro/research).
By commenting on and tagging our findings we were able to export a filtered
list of publications,
the relevance of which was agreed upon.

### Study Quality Assessment

<!-- TODO -->

### Data Extraction
To accurately capture the information contributed by each publication in our
survey, we will use a systematic approach to extracting data.
To guide this process, we will be using a data extraction form which describes
what aspects of a publication are crucial to record.
Besides general publication information (title, author etc.), the form contains
questions that are based on our defined research questions.
Furthermore, the form contains a section for quantitive research, where aspects
such as population and evaluation will be documented.
The form that is used for this is shown below:

```
General information:
	Name of person extracting data:
	Date form completed (dd/mm/yyyy):
	Publication title:
	Author information:
	Journal:
	Publication type:
	Type of study:

What practices in release engineering does this publication mention?

Are these practices to be classified under dated, state of the art or state of
the practice? Why?

What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?

What research gaps does this publication contain?

Are these research gaps filled by any other publications in this survey?

Quantitative research publications:
	Study start date:
	Study end date or duration:
	Population description:
	Method(s) of recruitment of participants:
	Sample size:
	Evaluation/measurement description:
	Outcomes:
	Limitations:
	Future research:

### Data Synthesis
To summarize the contributions and limitations of each of the included
publications, we will apply a descriptive synthesis approach.
In this part of our survey, we will compare the data that was extracted of the
included publications.
Publications with similar findings will be grouped and evaluated, and
differences between groups of publications will be structured and elaborated on.
In this we will compare them using specifics such as their study types, time of
publication and study quality.

If the extracted data allows for a structured tabular visualization of
similarities and differences between publications this we serve as an additional
form of synthesis. However, this depends on the final included publications of
this survey.
