## Charting the API minefield using software telemetry data

In this paper, researchers used software telemetry data from mobile application crashes. With heuristics, they separated the API calls from application calls so they can analyze what the most common causes for crashes are. Top crash causes are: memory exhaustion, race conditions or deadlocks, and missing resources. A significant percentage was not suitable for analysis as these crashes were associated with generic exceptions (10%). They performed a literature search to find solutions to the problems that cause the crashes. For each crash cause category, an implementation recommendation is made. More specific exceptions, non-blocking algorithms, and default resources can eliminate the most frequent crashes. They also suggest that development tools like memory analyzers, thread debuggers, and static analyzers can prevent many application failures. They also propose features of execution platforms and frameworks related to process and memory management that could reduce application crashes.

## Reproducing context-sensitive crashes of mobile apps using crowdsourced monitoring

The mobile applications market continues to grow and many applications are available. It is important for developers that their application keeps working and that crashes are fixed as fast as possible to keep up with competitors. However, the mobile market is tough: there are many different versions/hardware/steps end users take and it is hard to reproduce the environment and steps the end users take before running into a crash. This is why the researchers developed MoTiF which uses machine learning to reproduce the steps the end users take before the app crashes on the end userâ€™s phone and generates a test suite. MoTiF also uses the crowd to validate whether the generated test suite truly reproduces the observed crash.

## An exploratory study on faults in web api integration in a large-scale payment company

This research explores what the implications of web API faults are, what the most common web API faults are and best practices for API design. The faults in API integration can be grouped in 11 causes: invalid user input, missing user input, expired request data, invalid request data, missing request data, insufficient permissions, double processing, configuration, missing server data, internal and third party. Most faults can be attributed to the invalid or missing request data, and most API consumers seem to be impacted by faults caused by invalid request data and third party integration. Furthermore, API consumers most often use official API documentation to implement an API correctly, followed by code examples. The challenges of preventing problems from occurring are the lack of implementation details, insufficient guidance on certain aspects of the integration, insufficient understanding of the impact of problems, and missing guidance on how to recover from errors.

## Search-based test data generation for SQL queries

SQL queries should be tested as thoroughly as program code. However, it is hard to generate test data for testing. Other researchers proposed viewing this problem as a constraint solving problem, so test data could be generated with a SAT-solver. However, strings are not supported by current SAT-solver tools and it is a complex task to translate a query to a satisfiability problem. In this research, they view the test generation problem as a search-based problem. They use random search, biased random search and genetic algorithms (GA) to generate the data. The methods are combined in a tool called EvSQL and the tool is tested on more than 2000 queries. The GA method is the best and is able to cover a little over 98% of the queries. 

## Anomaly detection using program control flow graph mining from execution logs

They are trying to diagnose distributed applications. main cause of failures: when you make an API request to another application. This results in many new calls to other services or even other applications. This flow gets interrupted at some point. So when the top level API is not working, they want to show where it goes wrong. Before this paper, they used metrics and logs to find the cause. Drawbacks of this: many benign warnings or errors in healthy state or faults do not manifest as errors. Manually checking a transaction flow is also very hard. They use templates: print statements from the source code. These are the nodes, the edges are the flows. Two challenges: mining print statements is hard because parameters are different in every log and flows can happen at the same time. Their method: they do a join on two print statements if the statements are preceded and followed by approximately the same steps. Niet te lezen deze paper.
