# Release Engineering Analytics

## Motivation

Release engineering is a discipline involved with making software available for
end users.
Efforts spent within the development environment of a software system
should eventually be integrated and deployed such that end users may benefit
from them.
In recent years, release engineers have developed and
adopted techniques to build infrastructures and pipelines which automate the
process of releasing software to an increasingly large degree.
These modern approaches have resulted
in various practices such as releasing new versions of a software system in
significantly shorter cycles.

Due to these developments being industry-driven, release engineering forms a
largely uncharted territory for software engineering research.
It requires the attention from researchers both because these new practices
have an often unanticipated impact on software studies and because they require
empirical validation [@adams2016a].

Therefore, this systematic literature review aims to provide an overview of
the software analytics research that has been conducted so far on release
engineering. Its main purpose is to identify the apparent gap
between research and practice, in order to guide further research efforts.

### Research Questions

Contrary to what is regularly the case, with release engineering, practice
seems to be ahead of research.
Building on this idea, our questions are constructed to identify in which ways
existing modern release engineering practices should still be studied in
software analytics research.
Our review thus aims to answer the following questions.

<!-- TODO -->
- **RQ 1:** _How is modern release engineering done in practice?_<br>
  This question aims to identify the so-called "state of the practice" in
  release engineering.
  We will summarize practices that have been adopted to drive release
  engineering forward. In addition we will identify the tools utilized to bring
  this about. Case studies will also be analyzed to this end.

- **RQ 2:** _What aspects of modern release engineering have been studied
  in software analytics research so far?_<br>
  In order to answer this question we investigate the practices that previous
  empirical studies have focused on. In doing so, we identify the associated
  costs and benefits that have been found, and the analysis methods used.

- **RQ 3:** _What aspects of modern release engineering make for relevant
  study objects in future software analytics research?_<br>
  In answering this question we aim to identify the gap between practice and
  research in release engineering. This way, our intent is not only to guide
  but also to motivate future research.

## Research Protocol

<!-- TODO -->
In this section, we will describe...

### Search Strategy

Since release engineering is a relatively new research topic,
we took an exploratory approach in collecting any literature revolving around
the topic of release engineering from the perspective of software analytics.
This aided us in determining a more narrow scope for our survey,
subsequently allowing us to find additional literature fitting this scope.

At the start of this project, we were provided with an initial seed of five
papers as a starting point for our literature survey.
These initial papers were @adams2016a, @da2016a, @d2014a, @khomh2012a, and
@khomh2015a.

We collected publications using two search engines: Scopus and Google Scholar.
These each encompass various databases such as ACM Digital Library, Springer,
IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect.
The main query that we constructed is displayed in Figure 1.
The publications found using this query were:

- @kaur2019a
- @kerzazi2013a
- @castelluccio2017a
- @karvonen2017a
- @claes2017a
- @fujibayashi2017a
- @souza2015a
- @laukkanen2018a

_Figure 1. Query used for retrieving release engineering publications via Scopus._

In addition to querying search engines as described above,
references related to retrieved papers were analyzed.
For each paper, the review concerned the publications cited by the paper,
as well as those citing the paper.
These reference lists were obtained from Google Scholar and from the reference
lists in the papers themselves.
The results of the reference analysis are listed in Table 1.

_Table 1. Papers found indirectly by investigating citations of/by other papers._

| Starting point | Type        | Result                              |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| @souza2015a    | has cited   | @plewnia2014a   <br> @mantyla2015a  |
| @khomh2015a    | is cited by | @poo-caama2016a <br> @teixeira2017a |
| @mantyla2015a  | is cited by | @rodriguez2017a <br> @cesar2017a    |

All the papers that were found, were stored in a custom built web-based tool for
conducting literature reviews.
The source code of this tool is published in a
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/jessetilro/research).
The tool was hosted on a virtual private server, such that all retrieved
publications were stored centrally, accessible to all reviewers.

### Study Selection

In the utilized tool for conducting the survey, it is possible to label papers
with tags and leave comments and ratings.
Every paper is reviewed based on the selection criteria.
Based on this, the tool allowed to filter out all papers
that appeared not to be relevant for this literature survey.

The selection criteria are as follows:

1. The study must show (at least) one release engineering technique.
2. The study must not just show a release engineering technique,
   but analyze its performance compared to other techniques.

Based on these selection criteria,
the following papers appeared to be irrelevant for the scope of this survey:

<!-- Example. TODO: actually exclude papers -->
- [link to paper] - Excluded based on rule 2.

### Study Quality Assessment

Based on @kitchenham2004procedures, the quality of a paper will be assessed
by the evidence it provides, based on the following scale.
All levels of quality will be accepted, except for level 5 (expert opinion).

1. Evidence obtained from at least one properly-designed
   randomised controlled trial.
2. Evidence obtained from well-designed pseudo-randomised controlled trials
   (i.e. non-random allocation to treatment).
3. Comparative studies in a real-world setting:
    1. Evidence obtained from comparative studies with concurrent controls and
       allocation not randomised, cohort studies, case-control studies or
       interrupted time series with a control group.
    2. Evidence obtained from comparative studies with historical control,
       two or more single arm studies,
       or interrupted time series without a parallel control group.
4. Experiments in artificial settings:
    1. Evidence obtained from a randomised experiment performed in an
       artificial setting.
    2. Evidence obtained from case series,
       either post-test or pre-test/post-test.
    3. Evidence obtained from a quasi-random experiment performed in an
       artificial setting.
5. Evidence obtained from expert opinion based on theory or consensus.

Also, the studies will be examined to see if they contain any type of bias.
For this, the same types of biases will be used as described by @kitchenham2004procedures:

- Selection/Allocation bias: Systematic difference between comparison groups
  with respect to treatment.
- Performance bias: Systematic difference is the conduct of comparison groups
  apart from the treatment being evaluated.
- Measurement/Detection bias: Systematic difference between the groups in how
  outcomes are ascertained.
- Attrition/Exclusion bias: Systematic differences between comparison groups in
  terms of withdrawals or exclusions of participants from the study sample.

The studies will be labeled by their quality level and possible biases.
This information can be used during the Data Synthesis phase
to weigh the importance of individual studies [@kitchenham2004procedures].

### Data Extraction
To accurately capture the information contributed by each publication in our
survey, we will use a systematic approach to extracting data.
To guide this process, we will be using a data extraction form which describes
what aspects of a publication are crucial to record.
Besides general publication information (title, author etc.), the form contains
questions that are based on our defined research questions.
Furthermore, the form contains a section for quantitative research, where
aspects such as population and evaluation will be documented.
The form that is used for this is shown below:

```

### Data Synthesis
To summarize the contributions and limitations of each of the included
publications, we will apply a descriptive synthesis approach.
In this part of our survey, we will compare the data that was extracted of the
included publications.
Publications with similar findings will be grouped and evaluated, and
differences between groups of publications will be structured and elaborated on.
In this we will compare them using specifics such as their study types, time of
publication and study quality.

If the extracted data allows for a structured tabular visualization of
similarities and differences between publications this we serve as an additional
form of synthesis. However, this depends on the final included publications of
this survey.

### Included and Excluded Studies

### Project timetable

The literature review was conducted over the course of four weeks. We worked
iteratively and planned for four weekly milestones.

### Systematic literature review on the impacts of agile release engineering practices

Reference: @karvonen2017a

General information:

- Name of person extracting data: Jesse Tilro
- Date form completed: 29-09-2018
- Author information: Karvonen, T. and Behutiye, W. and Oivo, M. and Kuvaja, P.
- Publication type: Journal/Magazine Article
- Journal: Information and Software Technology
- Type of study: Systematic literature review

What practices in release engineering does this publication mention?

- Agile release engineering (ARE) practices
    - Continuous integration (CI)
    - Continuous delivery (CD)
    - Rapid Release (RR)
    - Continuous deployment
    - DevOps (similar to CD, congruent with release engineering practices)


Are these practices to be classified under dated,
state of the art or state of the practice? Why?

- State of the art, for it concerns a state of the art report and was published
  recently (2017).

What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?

- Claims that modern release engineering practices allow for software
  to be delivered faster and cheaper should be further empirically validated.
- This analysis could be extended with industry case studies, to develop a
  checklist for analyzing company and ecosystem readiness for continuous
  delivery and continuous deployment.
- The comprehensive reporting of the context and how the practice is
  implemented instead of merely referring to usage of the practice should be
  considered by future research.
- Different stakeholders' points of view, such as customer perceptions regarding
  practices require further research.
- Research on DevOps would be highly relevant for release engineering and the
  continuous software engineering research domain.
- Future research on the impact of RE practices could benefit from more
  extensive use of quantitative methodologies from case studies, and the
  combination of quantitative with qualitative (e.g. interviews) methods.
