Although re-search on this topic goes back for decades, the increasing heterogeneity and variability of software products along withthe recent trend to reduce the release cycle to days or even hoursstarts to question some of the common beliefs and practicesof the field. For example, a project like Mozilla Firefox releasesevery 6 weeks, generating updates for dozens of existing Fire-fox versions on 5 desktop, 2 mobile and 3 mobile desktopplatforms, each of which for more than 80 locales. In this con-text, the International Workshop on Release Engineering(RELENG) aims to provide a highly interactive forum for re-searchers and practitioners to address the challenges of, findsolutions for and share experiences with release engineering, and to build connections between the various communities. © 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Modern release engineering practices provide multiple benefits for software companies, but organizations have struggled when trying to adopt the most advanced practices, such as continuous delivery. It is not known in which contexts the most advanced practices are applicable and what can be achieved by adopting them. In this study, we discuss the effect of the organizational context on adopted release engineering practices and what outcomes are achieved with the practices. We study two organizational contexts: the startup and the large mature company context. The effect of the product context is mitigated by studying two case organizations with similar products, a rare research opportunity. We performed 18 interviews with various roles in the case organizations. The number of production environments, the number of customers, the control over the production environment, the available resources, the organization size and the distribution of the organization affected the release engineering practices and the ability to release frequently. Having less internal verification and more customer verification enabled fast feedback and customer experimentation in the startup context, but increased the number of production defects. However, having more internal verification in the large mature company context surprisingly did not prevent production defects. The organizational context had a large effect on how achievable modern release engineering practices, such as continuous delivery, were. In the startup context, the lack of resources was the main factor hindering the improvement of release engineering practices, while in the large mature company context, the number of stakeholders and products were the main factors. © 2018 The Author(s)},

  abstract = {Mozilla's decision to release a new version of its products every six weeks (instead of every year) profoundly affected developers and users and was accompanied by significant changes in the release process. Were such changes enough to allow Mozilla to move faster without breaking things? What lessons can be learned from Mozilla's adoption of rapid releases? To answer these questions, researchers analyzed tens of thousands of commits and bug reports from Firefox and talked to its developers. The results show that, because of integration repositories, build sheriffs, and better testing tools, broken patches were backed out (reverted) earlier, rendering the release process more stable. © 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract = {During the past years, overload at work leading to psychological diseases, such as burnouts, have drawn more public attention. This paper is a preliminary step toward an analysis of the work patterns and possible indicators of overload and time pressure on software developers with mining software repositories approach. We explore the working pattern of developers in the context of Mozilla Firefox, a large and long-lived open source project. To that end we investigate the impact of the move from traditional to rapid release cycle on work pattern. Moreover we compare Mozilla Firefox work pattern with another Mozilla product, Firefox OS, which has a different release cycle than Firefox. We find that both projects exhibit healthy working patterns, i.e. lower activity during the weekends and outside of office hours. Firefox experiences proportionally more activity on weekends than Firefox OS (Cohen's d = 0.94). We find that switching to rapid releases has reduced weekend work (Cohen's d = 1.43) and working during the night (Cohen's d = 0.45). This result holds even when we limit the analyzes on the hired resources, i.e. considering only individuals with Mozilla foundation email address, although, the effect sizes are smaller for weekends (Cohen's d = 0.64) and nights (Cohen's d = 0.23). Moreover, we use dissimilarity word clouds and find that work during the weekend is more technical while work during the week expresses more positive sentiment with words like 'good' and 'nice'. Our results suggest that moving to rapid releases have positive impact on the work health and work-life-balance of software engineers. However, caution is needed as our results are based on a limited set of quantitative data from a single organization. © 2017 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Context Agile release engineering (ARE) practices are designed to deliver software faster and cheaper to end users; hence, claims of such impacts should be validated by rigorous and relevant empirical studies. Objective The study objective was to analyze both direct and indirect impacts of ARE practices as well as to determine how they have been empirically studied. Method The study applied the systematic literature review research method. ARE practices were identified in empirical studies by searching articles for “rapid release,” “continuous integration,” “continuous delivery,” and “continuous deployment.” We systematically analyzed 619 articles and selected 71 primary studies for deeper investigation. The impacts of ARE practices were analyzed from three viewpoints: impacts associated with adoption of the practice, prevalence of the practice, and success of software development. Results The results indicated that ARE practices can create shorter lead times and better communication within and between development teams. However, challenges and drawbacks were also found in change management, software quality assurance, and stakeholder acceptance. The analysis revealed that 33 out of 71 primary studies were casual experience reports that had neither an explicit research method nor a data collection approach specified, and 23 out of 38 empirical studies applied qualitative methods, such as interviews, among practitioners. Additionally, 12 studies applied quantitative methods, such as mining of software repositories. Only three empirical studies combined these research approaches. Conclusion ARE practices can contribute to improved efficiency of the development process. Moreover, release stakeholders can develop a better understanding of the software project's status. Future empirical studies should consider the comprehensive reporting of the context and how the practice is implemented instead of merely referring to usage of the practice. In addition, different stakeholder points of view, such as customer perceptions regarding ARE practices, still clearly require further research. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {In rapid release development processes, patches that fix critical issues, or implement high-value features are often promoted directly from the development channel to a stabilization channel, potentially skipping one or more stabilization channels. This practice is called patch uplift. Patch uplift is risky, because patches that are rushed through the stabilization phase can end up introducing regressions in the code. This paper examines patch uplift operations at Mozilla, with the aim to identify the characteristics of uplifted patches that introduce regressions. Through statistical and manual analyses, we quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the reasons behind patch uplift decisions and the characteristics of uplifted patches that introduced regressions. Additionally, we interviewed three Mozilla release managers to understand organizational factors that affect patch uplift decisions and outcomes. Results show that most patches are uplifted because of a wrong functionality or a crash. Uplifted patches that lead to faults tend to have larger patch size, and most of the faults are due to semantic or memory errors in the patches. Also, release managers are more inclined to accept patch uplift requests that concern certain specific components, and-or that are submitted by certain specific developers. © 2017 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The dictum of ``Release early, release often.'' by Eric Raymond as the Linux modus operandi highlights the importance of release management in open source software development. Nevertheless, there are very few empirical studies addressing release management in open source software development. It is already known that most open source software communities adopt either feature-based or time-based release strategies. Each of these has its advantages and disadvantages that are context-specific. Recent research reported that many prominent open source software projects have moved from feature-based to time-based releases. In this longitudinal case study, we narrate how OpenStack shifted towards a liberal six-month release cycle. If prior research discussed why projects should adopt time-based releases and how they can adopt such a strategy, we discuss how OpenStack adapted its software development processes, its organizational design and its tools toward a hybrid release management strategy --- a strive for balancing the benefits and drawbacks of feature-based and time-based release strategies.},

  abstract = {Large open and closed source organizations like Google, Facebook and Mozilla are migrating their products towards rapid releases. While this allows faster time-to-market and user feedback, it also implies less time for testing and bug fixing. Since initial research results indeed show that rapid releases fix proportionally less reported bugs than traditional releases, this paper investigates the changes in software testing effort after moving to rapid releases in the context of a case study on Mozilla Firefox, and performs a semi-systematic literature review. The case study analyzes the results of 312,502 execution runs of the 1,547 mostly manual system-level test cases of Mozilla Firefox from 2006 to 2012 (5 major traditional and 9 major rapid releases), and triangulates our findings with a Mozilla QA engineer. We find that rapid releases have a narrower test scope that enables a deeper investigation of the features and regressions with the highest risk. Furthermore, rapid releases make testing more continuous and have proportionally smaller spikes before the main release. However, rapid releases make it more difficult to build a large testing community , and they decrease test suite diversity and make testing more deadline oriented. In addition, our semi-systematic literature review presents the benefits, problems and enablers of rapid releases from 24 papers found using systematic search queries and a similar amount of papers found through other means. The literature review shows that rapid releases are a prevalent industrial practice that are utilized even in some highly critical domains of software engineering, and that rapid releases originated from several software development methodologies such as agile, open source, lean and internet-speed software development. However, empirical studies proving evidence of the claimed advantages and disadvantages of rapid releases are scarce.},

  abstract = {Many software companies are shifting from the traditional multi-month release cycle to shorter release cycles. For example, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox release new versions every 6 weeks. These shorter release cycles reduce the users' waiting time for a new release and offer better feedback and marketing opportunities to companies, but it is unclear if the quality of the software product improves as well, since developers and testers are under more pressure. In this paper, we extend our previous empirical study of Mozilla Firefox on the impact of rapid releases on quality assurance with feedback by Mozilla project members. The study compares crash rates, median uptime, and the proportion of pre- and post-release bugs in traditional releases with those in rapid releases, and we also analyze the source code changes made by developers to identify potential changes in the development process. We found that (1) with shorter release cycles, users do not experience significantly more pre- or post-release bugs (percentage-wise) and (2) bugs are fixed faster, yet (3) users experience these bugs earlier during software execution (the program crashes earlier). Increased integration activity and propagation of harder bugs to later versions account for some of these findings. Overall, our case study suggests that a clear release engineering process with thorough automation is one of the major challenges when switching to rapid releases.},
