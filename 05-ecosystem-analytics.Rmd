# Ecosystem Analytics

## Motivation
In the modern day and age, the majority of software products make use of external software or
libraries to use the functionality (for example parsing JSON) of these libraries, without having to
develop this functionality itself. Moreover, multiple languages, such as Python and Rust, provide
package managers (pip[^1] and Cargo[^2] respectively) which can be used to easily manage this
third-party functionality, as well as distribute it.

In parallel to this, the popularity of creating open source projects is on the rise as well. On
platforms such as GitHub[^3], it is easy and quick to create a new software project, which can be
developed, reviewed and used by the whole community. This development leads to more libraries
being developed and being available for public use.

Because of these two developments, further inspection of the dependency relations between projects
leads to a graph-like structure of software projects. In this structure,the nodes are the projects
and the edges represent a dependency between two software projects. This structure is known as a
_software ecosystem_. As stated by @Messerschmitt2003, a _software ecosystem_ is "a collection of
software products that have some given degree of symbiotic relationships." Another, similar
definition is given by @Lungu2009: "A software ecosystem is a collection of software projects
which are developed and co-evolve in the same environment." @Mens2013 extends this definition,
"by explicitly considering the communities involved (e.g. user and developer communities) as
being part of the software ecosystem." @Stallman2002 opposes the overall notion of calling this 
structure a software ecosystem: "It is inadvisable to describe the free software community, or any
human community, as an ecosystem, because that word implies the absence of ethical judgment."

Although @Stallman2002 disagrees with the use of the term ecosystem, he does not
necessarily disagree with the definition of the term. The definition which will be used in
this chapter is the definition of @Mens2013, since it captures the essence of the other two
definitions, while adding the notion of the human communities alongside as well.

By performing analysis on these software ecosystems, the aim is to generate meaningful insights.
These insights can then be used to improve the efficiency and effectivity of the software
development process, as well as to learn to identify and inform about potential problems. For
example, a warning could be displayed if a dependency has a security vulnerability.

The field of research on software ecosystems, _ecosystem analytics_, focuses on performing such
analysis. This chapter discovers what the current progress is in this field of research through a
literature survey. This discovery is not limited to the theoretical perspective, but will uncover
practical implications as well as the open challenges of the field. In order to describe each
covered aspect, we have formulated three research questions:

* **RQ1**: What is the current state of the art in software analytics for ecosystem analytics?
* **RQ2**: What are the practical implications from the state of the art?
* **RQ3**: What are the open challenges in ecosystem analytics, for which future research is
required?

Each of these research questions will be answered using recent papers written in this field of
research.

This chapter is structured as follows. First, the research protocol is described in detail. This
includes decisions on which papers are included in the review. After this, the research questions
are answered using the previously stated set of papers.

## Research Protocol

In order to review literature to answer the research questions given in the previous section, the
survey method suggested by @Kitchenham2004 is used. This method creates a systematic way to select
a set of papers, which is relevant to the research question(s).

The search strategy, as described by @Kitchenham2004, are usually iterative and benefit from
consultations with experts in the field, amongst other things. Our search strategy can be split in
three different types:

* the initial seed, given by an expert in the field, MSc. Joseph Hejderup
* a search using a digital search engine, namely Google Scholar[^3]
* a selection of referenced papers within papers selected before in the above two searches

### Initial seed
MSc. Joseph Hejderup has provided us with a total of thirteen papers, as shown in Table 1.

As each of these papers come from an expert in the field, each paper is assumed to be relevant to
atleast the field of software ecosystems. Because of this, each of these papers were judged on
their relevance to either of the research questions. In Table 1, this relevance judgment is shown
in the left column, since a paper is only selected, if the paper is indeed relevant. Table 2
describes the reason for which each particular paper is not selected for the literature survey.

### Digital Search Engine
The second strategy type which is used to select relevant papers for this literature study, is by
a digital search engine. In this literature survey, Google Scholar[^3] is used. From the initial
seed, common keywords were retrieved and the following queries have been used to search for
relevant papers:

* "software ecosystems" AND "empirical analysis" _(2018)_
* "engineering software ecosystems" _(2014)_
* "software ecosystem" AND "empirical" _(2014)_
* "software ecosystem analytics" _(2014)_
* "software ecosystem" AND "analysis" _(2017)_
* "software ecosystem" AND "empirical" _(2018)_

For each of these queries, the results were first filtered by the publish year. These are
described by the italic year after each query above. The papers that are filtered are published
earlier than the set publish year. These specific years were chosen since the survey focuses on the
state of the art within the ecosystem analytics.

After this filtering, we first determined whether a paper was relevant to the literature survey by
examining the title. If it was unclear whether the paper was indeed relevant by only looking at
the title, the abstract of the paper was examined closely. On these two criteria, each of the
selected papers were judged and ultimately selected. The selected paper using these method can be
found in Table 3.

### Referenced papers
Finally, a selection of papers has been made by looking at the references found in papers
selected using the two methods above. For these papers, the selection process is similar to that
of the selected papers using the digital search engine; it is selected when both the title and the
abstract are deemed relevant to the research questions. This has led to the papers in Table 4.

## Answers
In this section, an aggregation of information, found in the papers, is presented. Each subsection
of this section focuses on one of the three research questions posed in Section 1.

### What is the current state of the art in software analytics for ecosystem analytics?
<!-- Topics that are being explored, research methods, tools and datasets being used -->
To answer this research question, we examine the explored topics in ecosystem analytics. Moreover,
we summarize which research methods, tools and datasets are being used to explore this topics.

#### Explored Topics
The main topic explored in the selected papers are related to the dependencies within the software
ecosystem. One of the main subjects related to these dependencies is the subject of breaking
changes between different versions of a package. @Bogart2016 researched the attitude of developers
of Eclipse, CRAN and NPM packages towards making breaking changes.

| Reference | Explored topic(s) | Research method(s) | Tool(s) | Dataset(s) | Ecosystem(s) | Conclusion |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| @Abdalkareem2017 | Empirical study on the use of trivial packages, as well as the reasoning behind this | Quantitative frequency, Survey | - | NPM, GitHub | NPM | Used because it is assumed to be well implemented and tested (only 45% actually has tests) and increases productivity. Quantitative research has shown that 10% of NodeJS uses trivial packages, where 16.8% are trivial packages in NPM |
| @Bogart2016 | Attitude of towards breaking changes and how do ecosystems influence this | Interviews | - | - | Eclipse, CRAM, NPM | There are numerous ways of dealing with breaking changes and ecosystems play an essential role in the chosen way. |
| @Decan2017 | Dependency Issues in OSS Packaging Ecosystems | Quantitative analysis | - | - | Eclipse, CRAM, NPM | In all ecosystems, dependency updates result in issues, however the problems and solutions do vary. |
| @Decan2018 | Quantitative empirical analysis of differences and similarities between the evolution of 7 varying ecosystems | Survival analysis | - | libraries.io | Cargo, CPAN, CRAN, npm, NuGet, Packagist, RubyGems | Package updates, which may cause dependent package failrues, are done on average every few months. Many packages in the analyzed package dependency networks were found to have a high number of transitive reverse dependencies, implying that package failures can affect a large number of other packages in the ecosystem. |
| @Dittrich2014 | The article provides a holistic understanding of the observed and reported practices as a starting point to device specific support for the development in software ecosystems | Qualitative interview study | - | - | - | The main contribution of this article is the presentation of common features of product development and evolution in four companies. Although size, kind of software and business models differ |
| @Izquierdo2018 | Code review analysis | Virtualization of process | - | Xen Github data | Xen | Analysis of code review has lead to more reviews and a more thoughtful and participary review process. Also providing accomodations for new software developers on OSS by easy access is very important. |

### What are the practical implications from the state of the art?
<!-- Rather than theoretical, actual case studies done with findings -->
In this research question we aim to find out the practical implications of the state of the art as
discussed in the previous section. Rather than a theoratical standpoint, we look at a practical
angle. The papers discussed in this section are mostly case studies and we will summarize their
findings. A schematic overview of our findings can be found in the table below. 

From most papers we find that developers are slow when updating their dependencies, or sometimes
they do not even do it at all. @Hora2016 suggest that a main reason for this is that breaking
changes cannot be solved in a uniform manner througout the ecosystem, but rather need a specific
implementation for each system. We have also found that breaking changes are constantly introduced
when dependencies are updated. According to @Raemaekers2017 about 33% of releases, either minor or
major, contain a breaking change that needs looking into. Breaking changes could pose compiling
errors, thereby breaking the system that depends on it. Furthermore, @Kula2017 has found that not
actively updating libraries leads to security risks. 

Regarding ecosystem health, @Constantinou2017 has researched which factors indicate that a
developer is likely to abandon an ecosystem. Their study, which analyzed Github issues and
commits, has found that developers are more likely to abandon a system when they 1) do not
communicate with their fellow developers, 2) do not participate often in social or technical
activities and 3) for an extended period of time do not react or commit anymore. 

@Malloy2018 has studied the transition from Python 2 to Python 3. Python 3 has been out since
2008, and the final Python 2 release was in 2010. Both are (almost) 10 years ago. Even though,
during their study they have found that most Python developers choose to maintain compatibility
with both Python 2 and Python 3 by only using a subset of the Python 3 language. By not using the
newly developed features they are severely limiting themselves in their language capabilities. 

Overall we can conclude that there are a lot of improvements to be made. The current method that
most users use to manage their dependencies is lacking. Whether it be updating late or not
updating at all, there are many risks bound to this. @Dietrich2014 has also found that there are a
lot of problems in the Java ecosystem, and has posed a set of relatively minor changes to both
development tools and the Java language itself that could be very effective. 

| Reference | Explored topic(s) | Research method(s) | Dataset(s) | Ecosystem(s) | Conclusion |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| @Hora2016 | Exploratory study aimed at observing API evolution and its impact | Empirical study | 3600 distinct systems | Pharo | After API changes, clients need time to react and rarely react at all. Replacements cannot be resolved in a uniform manner throughout the ecosystem. API changes and deprication can present different characteristics.
| @Kula2017 | An Empirical Study on the Impact of Security Advisories on Library Migration  | Empirical study | 4,600 GitHub software projects and 2,700 library dependencies | Github, Maven | Currently, developers do not actively update their libraries, leading to security risks. |
| @Constantinou2017 | Empirical comparison of developer retention in the RubyGems and NPM software ecosystems | Measurement of frequency and intensity of activity and retention | Github | NPM and RubyGems | Developers are more likely to abandon an ecosystem when they: 1) do not communicate with other developers, 2) do not have strong social and technical activity intensity, 3) communicate or commit less frequently and 4) do not communicate or commit for a longer period of time. |
| @Raemaekers2017 | To what degree do versioning schemes provide information signals about breaking changes | Snapshot analysis | More than 100.000 jar files from Maven Central | Maven | 1) Minor or major does not matter, both about 33% breaking chances, 2) breaking changes have significant impact and need fix before an upgrade, 3) Bigger libraries introduce more breaking changes, maturity is not a factor |
| @Malloy2018 | Analysis of the transition from Python 2 to Python 3 | Empirical impact study | 51 applications in the Qualitas suite for Python | Python | Most Python developers choose to maintain compatibility with Python 2 and 3, thereby only using a subset of the Python 3 language and not using the new features but instead limiting themselves to a language that is no longer under active development. |

### What are the open challenges in ecosystem analytics, for which future research is required?
<!--List of challenges, research questions and an aggregated set of open research items -->
This research question gives insight in the current open challenges in the field of ecosystem
analytics. It focuses on the challenges described in the studied papers.

The most common open challenge across almost all papers is the generalization of results. Most of
the studied papers only use a single ecosystem on which they base their results. This in turn
means that it is unsure whether these results hold for other ecosystems as well in a similar
fashion. For example, @Claes2015 states that a possibility for future work is to investigate to
what extent the findings can be reused in the framework of other package-based software
distributions.
However, even if multiple ecosystems are researched within one paper, it shows to still not be
enough to provide a generalization for each ecosystem. @Decan2018 states, after researching
dependency network evolution for seven ecosystems, that they do not make any claims that their
results can be generalised beyond the main package managers for specific languages. This is
because @Decan2018 do not expect similar results for networks such as WordPress, as these
packages tend to be more high-level (e.g. used by end users instead of reused by other packages).
This overall shows that there is a lot of space for future research to be done in generalizing
research beyond the already researched ecosystems.

Another persistent open challenge is the ability to determine the health of an ecosystem. Although
@Jansen2014 has provided OSEHO, "a framework that is used to establish the health of an open
source ecosystem", @Jansen2014 noted that "there is surprisingly little literature available about
open source ecosystem health". @Kikas2017 agree, stating that a general goal is to provide
analytics to maintainers about the overall ecosystem trends.

This challenge is related to determining a systems health. @Kikas2017 states that "a measure
quantifying dependency health in an ecosystem should be developed". Moreover, according to
@Jansen2014, determining the health of a system from an ecosystem perspective is required to
determine which systems to use.

Because of this, this challenge ties into the assistance while selecting packages as well. This
challenge is about selecting the best dependency, according to the functionality needs of the
existing application. @Abdalkareem2017 states that helping developers find the best packages
suiting their needs need to be addressed. @Kikas2017 agrees that another general goal is to
provide maintainers with tools to manage their dependencies.

However, whenever these dependencies are chosen, another open challenge is to assist maintainers
to keep these dependencies up to date. In order to find out when dependencies have to be updated,
metrics have to be defined. @Bavota2014 states that their observations could be a starting point
to build recommenders for supporting developers in complex dependency upgrade activity. @Cox2015
provided "a metric to aid stakeholdersin deciding on whether the dependencies of a system should
be updated". However, @Cox2015 states multiple refinements on this metric which could still be
researched.


| Reference | Open Challenges Found |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| @Abdalkareem2017 | Examine relationship between team experience and project maturity and usage of trivial packages |
| @Abdalkareem2017 | Compare use of code snippets on Q&A sites and trivial packages | 
| @Abdalkareem2017 | How to manage and help developers choose the best packages |
| @Decan2018 | Findings for one ecosystem cannot necessarily be generalized to another |
| @Decan2018 | Transitive dependencies are very frequent, meaning that package failrues can affect a large number of other packages in the ecosystem |
| @Jansen2014 | Determing the health of a system from an ecosystem perspective instead of project level is needed to determine which systems to use. This paper provides an initial approach but a lot more research could and should be done to determine system health. |
